# Gesture-Based Smart House Interface

This repository contains the code for SabancÄ± University's **CS449: Human-Computer Interaction Gesture-Based Interface Project**, which involves designing and implementing a PC-based smart house user interface controlled via hand gestures. 

The project leverages **MediaPipe** for detecting hand landmarks and uses **Python's tkinter library** to build the graphical user interface (GUI). This system allows users to interact with a virtual smart house environment using hand gestures.
